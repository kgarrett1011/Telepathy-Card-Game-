  <summary> How to Play </summary>
    1.  A number will be displayed on a card.
    
    2.  The player has a choice between Guess Higher or Guess Lower.  The player will click on which option they think the next card number will be.
    
    3.  Once the player has clicked their choice, the computer will generate the next card.
    
    4.  If the player chooses correctly, they will be prompted to choose again and will start accumulating points based on the numerical value of the card.  (a card with 7 on it is worth 7 points, a card with 5 on it is worth 5 points, etc).
    
    5.  As long as the player keeps choosing correctly, the computer will keep prompting them to guess again while adding points.
    
    6.  The game is over when the player guesses incorrectly.  A final score is shown and they have the option to play again.

## :satellite: Upcoming Features

- [:star:] Guess Streaks: when cards are guessed correctly a certain amount of times a win streak will appear and more cards will be added.  For example, you originally start with 13 cards, after the first guess streak of 3 the deck will increase from 13 to 20 cards making it more challenging.  After a 7 guess streak is achieved the deck goes from 20 cards to 30 cards making it more challenging to the player. The more guess streaks the player achieves the more cards are added to make it more challenging.
